        <p>Most Assuredly Series</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafer you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man. (1:51)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. (3:3)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. (3:5)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive our witness. If I have told earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? no one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God. (3:11-21)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the son also does in like manner. For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He himself does; and He will show Him greater work than these, that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will. For the Father judges no one, but has commited all judgement to the Son, that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. (5:19-24)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life. (5:24)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, and has given Him authority to execute judgement also, because He is the Son of Man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth - those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation. I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and My judgement is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.  (5:25-30)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him(6:27)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world (6:30)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world (6:47-51)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me. This is the bread which came down from heaven - not as your fathers ate the manna, and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever. (6:58
            )</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commites sin is a slave of sin. And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever. Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed. (8:34)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death. (8:51)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM. (8:58)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the sheperd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. Yet they will by no means follwo a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers. (10:1-4)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who ever came before Me are theives and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they may hav life, and that they may have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep (10:7-12)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. He who lovs his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servants will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor. (12:24-27)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. (13:20)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, the rooster shall not crow till you have devied Me three times. (13:38)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and gretater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. (14:12)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turned into joy. A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you. And in that day you will ask Me nothing (16:20-23)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full (16:23-24)</li>
            <li>Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were yonger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish. (21:18)</li>
